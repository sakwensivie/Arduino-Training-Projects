# Digital Hourglass

Up till now the main way of using timing in our programs is to use the `delay()` function. But this freezes its current state for the duration of the delay, making it not suitable for timing your projects. So to time your projects, you can use the `millis()` function. 

To create variables of timing, we would have to use a type that is suitable for time. The `unsigned long` type which would have a count up to 4,294,967,295. That's about 50 days of timing.

 
 Because we would be using a tilt sensor so that the circuit simulates an hourglass.
