# 05-mood\_cue


## Using a servo motor to make a mechanical gauge to point out what sort of mood you're in the day.

### Servo Motor:  
This is a special type of motor that don't spin around in a circle, but move to a specific position and star there until you tell them to move again.   

The goal of this project was to use a potentiometer to control the angle of the servo motor. In place of the potentiometer, any other sonsor can be used to contrl the servo.
